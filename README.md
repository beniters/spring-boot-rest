# NinjaOne Backend Interview Project

The project is configured to use an in-memory H2 database that is volatile. If you wish to make it maintain data on application shut down, you can change the spring.database.jdbc-url to point at a file like `jdbc:h2:file:/{your file path here}`

## Starting the Application

Run the `BackendInterviewProjectApplication` class

Go to:
* http://localhost:8080/sample/1
* http://localhost:8080/sample/2

** *More details this json file for postman collections can be used to call the endpoins*
* [Postman collection](postman_collection/ninja_one_test.postman_collection.json)

You should see results for both of these. The application is working and connected to the H2 database. 

## H2 Console 

In order to see and interact with your db, access the h2 console in your browser.
After running the application, go to:

http://localhost:8080/h2-console

Enter the information for the url, username, and password in the application.yml:

```yml
url: jdbc:h2:mem:localdb
username: sa 
password: password
```

You should be able to see a db console now that has the Sample Repository in it.

Type:

```sql
SELECT * FROM SAMPLE;
````

Click `Run`, you should see two rows, for ids `1` and `2`
